    <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Stype Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</p>
    <div>
        <p>
            With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing betwwen elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
            background image or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
        </p>
    </div>
    <p class="bg-yellow"><b>Tip: </b>The word <b>cascading</b> means that a stype applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you
    set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color(unless)
you specify something else</p>
